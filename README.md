## Exercise 1:

Create a new public class named BankAccount

In your BankAccount class, create the following:
+ A private field of type double named balance with a value of 0
+ Define a method named Deposit that will accept a double and store that value in the balance field
+ Define a method named GetBalance that will return the amount stored in the balance field

In the main method of your application, create a new instance of the BankAccount class. Allow the user of the application to Deposit money and retrieve their balance through the console.
